 <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    <p>Hello and thank you for visiting! This is my very first attempt at building a webpage using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I'm just getting started on my web development journey, and I'm excited to learn and grow.</p>
    <p>On this page, you'll find a simple layout, a styled button, and a small interaction made using JavaScript. It's basic now, but every expert once started right hereâ€”with their first webpage!</p>
    <p>Click the button below to see a friendly message. I hope you enjoy exploring this as much as I enjoyed creatingÂ it.</p>
    <p> html (HyperText Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web.</p>
